# source-codes-reviwer

The programming test is your opportunity to show of your technical excellence. It is an important part in showing of who you are and what you stand for. In many aspects it is more important than the CV you sent us, as this tells us more about what choices you make as a developer, and how you chose to solve problems presented to you.

        • Please use good practices as a programmer when solving the problem.
        • Please document and have unit-tests.

Write a program that reads a source code file (a good default might be itself), and counts how many lines of code the program contains. Extra points for also counting number of lines contain comments and how many blank lines there are.
